    "body": "During my immersive coding bootcamp experience, I collaborated with a team to develop a sophisticated project — a MVP version with a distinct emphasis on route optimisation. Demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the project's intricacies, I took charge of the entire route management aspect.\nThe purpose of this initiative was to enhance the safety of young cyclists. Leveraged Leaflet.js and TomTom's Routing/Reverse Geolocation APIs.\nIn practical terms, this translates to the creation of a interactive map. Users can intricately plan their routes, considering factors such as real-time traffic updates, designated bike lanes, and terrain gradients. The result is a visually appealing mapping experience. An adventure plotted with utmost consideration for safety and enjoyment.",

This creates urgency to answer carefully within the time limit. Questions are drawn randomly from a pool to ensure variety upon each attempt.\nBuilt using JavaScript, this project provides hands-on experience creating a responsive quiz application. Key learning outcomes include: \n➤ Generating random questions from a pool of options\n➤ Implementing a countdown timer with penalty deductions\n➤ Calculating scores based on time remaining\n➤ Providing interactive quiz feedback to users\nOverall, this application allows users to test their JavaScript skills through an engaging, time-pressured quiz interface. Both code knowledge and quick thinking are required to achieve a top score.",
